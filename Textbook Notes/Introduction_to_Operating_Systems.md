# Introduction to Operating Systems
- The basic **Von Neumann** model of computing involves a processor *fetching* an instruction from memory, *decoding* it, and then *executing* the decoded instruction, repeating such steps with subsequent instructions until the program completes
- In actuality, while a program runs, other things occur in the background in order to ensure that the system running the program is easy to use - the **operating system** is in charge of ensuring the system operates correctly and efficiently in an easy-to-use manner
- A common technique done by the operating system is **virtualization**, which involves taking a physical resource (processor, memory, disk, etc.) and transforming it into a general *virtual* form of itself, which gives other programs the "illusion" that it has sole access to that resource when in actuality it does not
    - Virtualizing the CPU allows for programs to be run in (seemingly) parallel even if there is only a single CPU
    - Virtualizing memory allows for programs to access their own private *virtual address space* which the operating systems maps to physical memory - this virtual address space is isolated from other processes
- Users can make use of the functionality of operating systems through interfaces, typically through **system calls** that are available to applications, also known as the **standard library**
    - System calls work by transferring control to the operating system and raising the **hardware privilege level**; normally, programs run in **user mode** meaning that they are restricted from certain actions (i.e. I/O or disk access), but when a system call is made, the program is **trapped** into **kernel mode** where it has full access to the hardware and can make necessary requests. After such a request is done, a **return-from-trap** instructions reverts the program to user mode
- Operating systems also deal with the issue of **concurrency**, which tends to arise when dealing with *multi-threaded* programs - a *thread* can be thought of as a function running in the same memory space as other functions and active at the same time
    - When multiple threads are working towards the same instruction, it is important to ensure that the instruciton is *atomic*, or all at once, as otherwise concurrency issues arise
- Another major issue that operating systems deal with is that of **persistence** - that is, being able to store data permanently in an *I/O* device such as a *hard disk* or *solid-state drive*
    - Operating systems manage such disks through a *file system*. Files in a file system are *not* virtual as it is assumed that files are meant to be shared 
    - Operating systems deal with the actual interfaces of I/O devices and hide the complex details of dealing with such devices behind system call interfaces
- Operating systems make use of **abstractions** to make the system easier to use, strive for high **performance** (minimizing time or space overheads), tend towards **protection** between applications and between the operating system and applications (such as through isolating processes), and maintain **reliability**
